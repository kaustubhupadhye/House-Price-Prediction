# House-Price-Prediction

Team 4: Housing Price Prediction

Problem Statement:
It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must 
predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

Goal:
It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must 
predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 
Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of 
the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that 
errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.) 


In this case study we did EDA, feature selection and modelling to predict housing prices 
using Advanced Regression Analysis. We have listed out the steps below:

Sr. No. Title
1 Exploratory Data Analysis
1.1 General Exploration
1.2 Numerical Features
1.2.1 Explore and clean Numerical features
1.2.2. Missing data of Numerical features
1.3 Categorical features
1.3.1. Explore and clean Categorical features
1.3.2. Missing data of Categorical features
1.3.3. Transform Categorical features into Binary features
1.4 Merge numerical and binary features into one data set
1.5 Drop outliers from the train set
2 Feature engineering
3 Preparing data for modelling
3.1 Target variable 'SalePrice'
3.2 Split data into train and test and Standardization
3.3 Backward Stepwise Regression
4 Modelling
4.1 Models and metrics selection
4.2 Hyperparameters tuning and model optimization
4.2.1. Ridge regression
4.2.2. Lasso regression
4.2.3. XGBoost regression
4.3 Choosing the best model
4.4 Prediction on 'House Prices-Advanced Regression Techniques' test data 
set
5 Conclusion



WIth using Xgboost,lasso and Ridge regression we have gained accuracy upto 90%.And proven effective model in our INstitute.
